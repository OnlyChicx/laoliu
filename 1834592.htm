<table class="shipping"><tbody>

<p>* Why is Air (Standard)shipping not available for some items?<br/>Air shipping is more than Express shipping for items weighing totally over 700g (approximately 1.5lbs). Therefore, it creates a loss for customers to choose Air on this occasion (which is more expensive and less speedy). So we cancel this service on this occasion because Rikoo always tries its best to provide consideration and convenience to our customers.</p>
